This directory contains the files which describe the radiative neutron capture
by gadolinium. To use this new class you need to:  

1-Put the Gd_n_capture.tgz file in the same directory as the 
physicslists that you are using (i.e. DCGLG4sim or GLG4sim directory)
and do "tar -xzvf Gd_n_capture.tgz" 

2-Insert the following line:  # include "GdNeutronHPCapture.hh" in your 
GLG4PhysicsList.cc or in DCGLG4PhysicsHadron.cc 

3-In the same last file you replace the calling of G4NeutronHPCapture by 
GdNeutronHPCapture as following:
 	
	//G4NeutronHPCapture* theNeutronHPCapture
        //  = new   G4NeutronHPCapture();

         GdNeutronHPCapture* theNeutronHPCapture
                = new   GdNeutronHPCapture();


4- Do gmake for  GLG4sim and DCGLG4sim if you changed GLG4sim.If you make the 
change of DCGLG4sim you must compile only this one.
